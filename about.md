Hi! I'm Antony, better known as G4L1T0, I'm 18 years old, and I live in Ceilândia, Brasília, Brazil. Today I am a high school student integrated into the electronics technical course at the Federal Institute of Brasília (IFB).

I am one of the founders of [Boitatech](https://www.boitatech.com.br/), a community focused on hacking and programming, I am also the founder of the CTF team called [InitOne](https://initone.com.br/). I am currently an intern on the *Pentest as a Service* team at [Conviso Application Security](https://www.convisoappsec.com/).

The purpose of this blog is to show you a little about the topics I'm currently studying and publish notes I took during my studies.
