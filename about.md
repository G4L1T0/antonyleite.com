I'm Antony, also known as G4L1T0, I'm 19 years old.

I completed the Electronics Technician course integrated into high school at the Federal Institute of Bras√≠lia. I have the Desec Certified Penetration Tester ([DCPT](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dcpt-desec-certified-penetration-tester-ricardo/?originalSubdomain=pt)) certification and I am an active member of the [Boitatech](https://www.boitatech.com.br/) Community, a Brazilian community focused on hacking.

The purpose of this blog is to show you a little about the topics I'm currently studying and publish notes I took during my studies.
